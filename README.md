## About:
This project aims to create the most feature complete save editor for Metroid: Samus Returns. My research and discussion thread on gbatemp can be found [here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/another-metroid-samus-returns-save-editor.488164/).

Currently, the latest version supports full manipulation of the inventory block within the common.bmssv file. To modify a save file, open the common.bmssv file for the profile you wish to edit. When done making changes, choose the location of where to save the modified common.bmssv.
